                <p>
                    There are several development tools to choose from. In COMP 1950 we will use the open source Integrated Devlopment Environment (IDE) from Microsoft called Visual Studio Code (VS Code). This is more than a simple text editor, it provides robust code editing, maintenance and testing features, as well as supporting plugins to further increase it's capabilities.

                    VS Code should already be installed on COMP1950 lab computers. The executable is found at C:/Program Files/Microsoft VS Code/Code.exe Laptop / Home Desktop

                <p>As web pages get more complex, it can become difficult figuring out what is going on.

You will be required to use them in the classes ahead. Practice adding/editing/removing both HTML and CSS using your development browser's built in tools.</p>

                    Web Browser Tools: Typical Features
                </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>F12 key will toggle open/close the tools in most browsers</li>
                    <li>The Elements/Inspector tab provides an overview of the HTML and CSS</li>
                    <li></li>The Select tool can be used to analyze the structure of the page and understand he status of box models</li>
                    <li>The Console will display Javascript behaviours and error messages</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The capabilities of these browser tools go well beyond outlining, examining and editing. They provide deep troubleshooting capabilities of the HTTP network, javascript and even XHR (XMLHttpRequest).</p>

                    <li>Web standards have gone through the same process that the ISO went through</li>
                    <li>Many companies see the benefits of interoperability - a few are still "forging their own"</li>
                    <li>Many companies have standards: Adobe, Microsoft, Apple, Ford, GM</li>
                    <li>Many are proprietary standards, and are not supported by other companies</li>
                    <li>W3C - World Wide Web Consortium: founded by Tim Berners-Lee to try and uniformly put forward standards through a single communication vehicle</li>
                    <li>Leading browser makers did not follow, initially</li>
                    <li>Designers were 'taking sides' in the browser wars: users were losers</li>
                    <li>Most modern browsers are fairly standards compliant</li>

                    Naming Conventions
                </h3>
                <p>HTTP urls cannot contain certain characters, and certain characters will cause unwanted effects and behaviours when used in a url. Follow best practices for all file and folder names:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        File and folder names should NOT contain:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Capital letters</li>
                            <li>Spaces</li>
                            <li>Special characters: ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) + { } [ ] : ; " < > ? | etc...</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Acceptable non-alphanumeric characters: . _ - ~</li>
                    <li>Filenames should either be descriptive of the file contents, or use the default page name: index.htm, index.html or index.shtml (or whatever your server default is)</li>
                    <li>Folder names should always be descriptive. Folder structure should be logical (eg: /hockey/nhl/canucks).</li>

                <h3>
                    index.html
                </h3>
                <p>Including an index.html file in every folder on your server will ensure users cannot go snooping around your filesystem. the index.html file can be a blank HTML page if you like, as long as the user does not see a list of files when they request a folder</p>
                <h3>
                    Browser Caching
                </h3>
                <p>Browser caching can reduce excessive request/response transactions between client and server. however, some browsers may cache things like the CSS, so if the styles have changed since caching the client may not get the latest styles.</p>

                    Ctrl + F5 (Cmd F5 for Mac)

                <ul>
                    <li>Ctrl + F5 (Cmd + F5 for Mac) will force a page reload. Very useful when developing on a localhost http server.</li>
                    <li>If a file name has changed, the browser will have to make a new request from the server. versioning your file names will ensure users always have the latest version of any file (for example styles_1.0.css, styles_1.1.css, styles_1.2.css, styles_2.0.css etc)</li>
                    <li>If there are files/pages on your server no longer being used, be sure to either remove them or locate them in a place where users are not going to accidentally find them</li>

                <li>In HTML, use carriage return and tabs to indicate parent-child tag relationships. Likewise, code your CSS to make it easy to see which rules are applied to each selector.</li>
