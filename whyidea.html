                <p>
                    I've also been a more sensitive human - ever since I was a little kid I always worried about others feelings more than my own.  I would help others without thinking about myself.  This meant that I would do things to support others that stressed me out, and crying off the stress later at home alone.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Throughout my childhood I was considered to be 'slow', I wasn't able to keep up with my peers.  With growing up in the 90's, I was pushed along to the next grade every year to prevent social impacts of being held behind year.  I will never know if this was the best choice for me.

                <p>
                    Providing equal access to oportunities and resources for people who might otherwise be excluded or marginalized.  Inclusivity is so much more than a window display, it is an outpouring of diversity from the inside.

                    Understanding that each individual is unique and embracing these differences - these include any experiences that impact how we interact with the world around us.  Some examples are race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, socio-economic status, age, physical/mental abilities, religious beliefs and political beliefs.

                <p>
                    The act of both sharing and receiving information for the purpose of growth and development.  My hope for IDEA is to create a safe space where experiences can be shared, learned and explored.  Every one of us is on a journey - collaboration is how we can grow.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    The intentional act of making information, activities and environments meaningful and enhancing practical real world solutions for as many people as possible.  My goal for IDEA is to show that accessibility can look good while supporting developers as they make small changes that have a big impact.
