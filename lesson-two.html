                        Charset Recommendations
                    </h3>
                    <p>The W3C recommends the UTF-8 charset for web development. It includes an impressive array of languages and special characters, and is well supported in common devices</p>
                    <h3>
                        Assign Character Set
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        If it is not specified, a web browser will choose the character set it thinks is most appropriate, but it is a better practice for the developer to ensure the correct character set by applying the meta tag to the head section of every HTML page:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        UTF-8

                        Tips

                    <ul>
                        <li>Write all your text-based code (.html, .css, .js, .php, etc) in UTF-8. At development time, ensure your text editor is saving files in this format. This setting is usually found in the application's Preferences menu option.</li>
                        <li>Unless your audience includes very old browsers, you can code special characters directly into the HTML (you dont need to use HTML entities for most special characters).</li>
                        <li>You cannot copy-paste rich text (such as Microsoft Word, or WordPad) into your HTML. The rich text formatting may result in an unreadable mess.</li>
                        <li>An HTTP server can over-ride your charset preferences when it generates the HTTP header. Details on how to control this will be discussed later in this course.</li>

                    <p>Use the lang="" attribute to declare the language in HTML. This is usually applied to the html element. Assigning the appropriate language code will apply to all contained content, unless over-ridden with another lang="".</p>

                        <li>Over the next decade, various additions, improvements and changes are introduced</li>
                        <li>HTML 4.01 released in December 1999</li>
                        <li>Initially used for documents and a place for the technically inclined, the web did not have the international pervasiveness it does today</li>
                        <li>Most developers were new to the language and there were no real classes in it</li>
                        <li>People had to learn as they went along</li>

                    <p>It is crucial for all HTML content to be semantically marked up. This is how browsers, search engines, and screen readers make sense of online content.</p>
                    <p>HTML5 provides more than just adjustments to the markup, there are new, powerfully semantic elements:    
                    </p>
                    <dl>
                        <dt>section</dt>
                        <dd>is a tag representing a document or application section. in general, if you are planning to use a heading, start a new section. a section must contain a heading, and may contain article(s), possibly asides or even sub-sections</dd>
                        <dt>article</dt>
                        <dd>is an independent piece of content in a document (it could stand alone if removed from the page). an article might be a blog post, forum thread, news story, collection of product information, etc</dd>
                        <dt>aside</dt>
                        <dd>is for content "only slightly" related to the main page content. asides fill the role of a sidebar. if the content could be removed without reducing the meaning of the main content of the HTML document, then use an aside</dd>
                        <dt>header & footer</dt>
                        <dd>for the header or footer of a page</dd>
                        <dt>nav</dt>
                        <dd>represents an area for navigation</dd>
                        <dt>main</dt>
                        <dd>used for containing content that is focused on the central topic of the page. this content is usually unique to the page, and not shared by other pages (main will usually NOT contain navigations, footers, sidebars, etc)</dd>
                        <dt>figure</dt>
                        <dd>will likely contain an img or graphic. self-contained content (could usually be removed from the page and stand on its own). allows for captioning of embedded content like an image graphic or video. if you want to associate a caption, add a figcaption child</dd>
                        <dt>figcaption</dt>
                        <dd>used as first or last child of figure to define the caption or legend for a figure</dd> 
                    </dl>
                    <p>These represent some big changes in HTML, allowing for more flexibility in coding and specifying content. Many of these will replace and reduce the need for many div tags.</p>

                    <h3>Semantic Alterations</h3>
                    <p>HTML5 also brings a few notable semantic alterations to older tags:</p>

                    <dl>
                        <dt>a</dt>
                        <dd>though still an inline tag, it is now ok to nest multiple block level tags (headings, paragraphs etc) inside an anchor tag</dd>
                        <dt>small</dt>
                        <dd>no longer a 'physical' tag for smaller sized print, it now has semantic value: meaning 'small print', i.e. 'legalese'. the big element has been deprecated</dd>
                        <dt>b</dt>
                        <dd>no longer means 'render bold'. now it means the text is 'stylisticly offset from the normal text', without conveying any extra importance. to convey extra importance, use strong</dd>
                        <dt>i</dt>
                        <dd>now means the text is 'in an alternate voice or mood', without conveying any extra emphasis. to convey extra emphasis, use em </dd>
                        <dt>Deprecated tags</dt>
                        <dd>big, font, strike, and a few more. Developers should use CSS instead of these deprecated tags</dd>
                        <dt>Deprecated Attributes</dt>
                        <dd>align, bgcolor, border, height, size, type, width and more. Developers should use CSS instead of these deprecated attributes.</dd>

                        Sectioning Content
                    </h3>
                    <p>The section tag can be used to semantically group content. It can remove ambiguity when a page is being processed by the browser, a screen reader, or search engine.</p>
                    <p>Since content that follows a heading is presumed to be associated with that heading, the code above carries plenty of semantic value already. But, if the small tag's content is intended to apply to all cities, a browser has no way of knowing that. It will instead assume the small tag is associated with the preceding heading</p>
                    <p>In HTML5, each piece of sectioned content has its own self-contained outline. This means you wont need to worry as much about which level heading tag to use. You can use an h1 inside a section and it will be treated as the heading of the section, and have lesser semantic impact than an h1 that is at a higher level.</p>

                    <h3>Form Attributes</h3>
                    <p>HTML 5 adds several new form attributes that prove quite useful, even if some are as yet poorly supported.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>placeholder="value": prepopulates field with data</li>

                        <li>
                            There are also several new "input" type attribute variants:
                            <ul>
                                <li>type="email": checkes for the pattern of emails</li>

                                <li>type="date": calendar popup</li>
                                <li>type="tel": telephone numbers</li>
                                <li>type="search": formats text input as search input</li>
                                <li>type="color": color picker popup</li>
                                <li>type="range": sliding scales</li>
                                <li>type="pattern": regular expression pattern matching</li>

                    <p>Scaleable Vector Graphics (SVG) can be embedded into HTML5 documents. SVG are 100% scalable without the pixelated effect that scaled raster images can suffer from. SVG file data is stored as text, so they are much smaller in file size than a raster equivalent.</p>
                    <p>You can use SVG graphics with the img tag, just as with raster graphics. You can also use .svg as a CSS background-image.</p>

                        User agent browsers will have varying support for the HTML5 specification.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>caniuse.com is an excellent source for compatibility testing</li>
                        <li>Try the HTML5Test to test a specific browser.</li>
                        <li>
                            To ensure early versions of Internet Explorer will render HTML5 tags correctly, you can add the HTML5 shiv
                            <ul>
                                <li>This creates an element called article which the browser (IE, in this case) can understand and style appropriately</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Creating an entry for every element can get a bit heavy, so you can use the HTML5shiv script written by Remy Sharp. Insert a coded-comment that will apply the shiv ONLY with IE browsers earlier than version 9</li>
                        <li>•	Since HTML5 understands both HTML4 and XHTML tags, converting an older HTML file into HTML5 is simply a matter of updating the DOCTYPE and meta tag for charset.</li>
