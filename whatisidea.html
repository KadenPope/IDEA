                <p>
                    To provide developers and designers with the resources to open the dialogue about Universal Design and make tangible changes to their websites right away.  My hope is to see a day when all websites are created with Inclusivity, Diversity, Education and Accessibility in mind.  By making small changes, we are taking the time to show everyone that their experience is valid.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    The goal is to represent the diversity of the world we live in.  I strongly believe that inclusivity goes above and beyond making content accessible for those with disabilities - this includes embracing all people especially their quirks and individuality.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    Providing equal access to oportunities and resources for people who might otherwise be excluded or marginalized.  Inclusivity is so much more than a window display, it is an outpouring of diversity from the inside.

                <p>
                    Understanding that each individual is unique and embracing these differences - these include any experiences that impact how we interact with the world around us.  Some examples are race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, socio-economic status, age, physical/mental abilities, religious beliefs and political beliefs.

                <p>
                    The act of both sharing and receiving information for the purpose of growth and development.  My hope for IDEA is to create a safe space where experiences can be shared, learned and explored.  Every one of us is on a journey - collaboration is how we can grow.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    The intentional act of making information, activities and environments meaningful and enhancing practical real world solutions for as many people as possible.  My goal for IDEA is to show that accessibility can look good while supporting developers as they make small changes that have a big impact.
