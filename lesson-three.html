                    <p>
                        When linking to external style sheets, there are a number of features to be aware of:
                    </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Each stylesheet requires it's own link tag</li>
                            <li>Multiple stylesheets can be loaded (main.css, fonts.css, layout.css, etc)</li>
                            <li>rel determines how the HTML will use the file linked to (REQUIRED)</li>
                            <li>href defines the path, relative or absolute, to the css file (REQUIRED)</li>
                            <li>type attribute is has been deprecated (dropped in HTML5)</li>
                            <li>title attribute allows the user to group stylesheets</li>
                            <li>
                                media attribute allows you to specify what medium this should be viewed in
                                <ul>
                                    <li>&lt; link	rel="stylesheet"</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>media="type" can be a powerful tool</li>
                        <li>
                            Examples of media types:
                            <ul>
                                <li>all - well supported, commonly used (DEFAULT)</li>
                                <li>aural</li>
                                <li>braille</li>
                                <li>embossed</li>
                                <li>handheld - not common (smart phones identify as screen)</li>
                                <li>print - well supported, commonly used</li>
                                <li>projection</li>
                                <li>screen - well supported, commonly used</li>

                            Note that most smart phone devices (iPhones, Andriod, etc) do not identify themselves as media type handheld. The reasoning was that the devices were more than capable of displaying standard web sites, so they identify as screen

                        <li>TIP: If you have multiple sheets that belong to one "look" make sure they all have the same title</li>
                        <li>You can create alternate style sheets for users, allowing them to select which ones they would like to see</li>
                        <li>â€¢	An example would be to create a 'Larger Text' style sheet with everything in a larger font, or providing an option for users to choose an austere, simple page instead of a colorful/image heavy stylesheet</li>
                        <li>Many browsers are now giving users the ability to select which sheet they would like to see. (Firefox: View > Page Style)</li>

                        <li>Finally, a stylesheet is "alternate" if it is linked with rel="alternate stylesheet" and has a title. These stylesheets are supposed to allow the user to choose stylesheets, they are grouped together by title and show up in the browser's stylesheet selector if it has one (View > Page Style in Firefox). Each group (by title) is mutually exclusive.</li>

                    <p>
                        You can use the @import method to import multiple stylesheets from a basic stylesheet that you link to. This will reduce the clutter that can sometimes occur within the &lt;head&gt; section.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is also a great place to be able to manage your CSS. From your main document, create a &lt;link&gt; to your styles.css page.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the body of the styles.css file, import as many files as you need:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>@import url("css/type.css");</li>
                        <li>@import url("css/nav.css");</li>
                        <li>@import url("css/template.css");</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="important">NOTE: when using the @import directive in an external CSS file, ensure it comes before your CSS selector rules. It might be best to not include any CSS rules in a page that uses @import.</p>

                    <p>
                        If your CSS files only contain standard keyboard characters, assigning the character set is not required. The CSS language itself does not use any exotic characters, so assigning a charset is often omitted. If, however, your CSS needs to use special characters, ensuring the correct character set can be very important. Eg: When using a pseudoclass to add content to HTML content: "Ã„wesome!"
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If needed, add the @charset rule to the top of the CSS document.

                        <li>px - Pixels is one of the most common measuring types. It is specific to computers, as it renders based on the pixel-display of all monitors. Great for specific measurements on boxes and borders, but for fonts, it can lead to difficulty as some browsers don't allow scaling and font can end up too small</li>
                        <li>% - Percentage measurements are also very common.</li>
                        <li>em - A relative measurement of the letter "m" in the chosen font. This is a popular one for spacing around text, as it inherits the font dimensions</li>
                        <li>rem - Similar to em, this will inherit only the Root value, helpful for avoiding 'compound inheritance' values</li>
                        <li>pt - Points is an aold system related to type-setting that had a standard size for points. This is a relative size based on the users' system</li>
                        <li>pc - Picas is a very old system that was frequently related to typewritten documents. Rarely used.</li>
                        <li>ex - Similar to em, this is a relative measurement of the letter "x". However, it is rarely used, and not fully supported</li>
                        <li>vh, vw, vmin, vmax - size relative to viewport widths and heights. very useful for scaling, though may not enjoy full support yet</li>
                        <li>named - This refers to fonts and a few other elements. The named sizes are xx-small, x-small, small, medium, large, x-large, xx-large. They are relative to the browsers base font size</li>

                    <p>
                        Colors can be specified in a number of ways, corresponding to the system that your organization or visual element requires. Almost all color systems use a method for expressing a combination of the three color spaces used for displaying colors on computer monitors: Red Green and Blue.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Hex: #003366 - One of the most common systems, it combines 2 digits each for Red Green and Blue. Each hex pair stand stands for digits between 00 and FF in hexadecimal</li>
                        <li>Compact Hex: #f30 - This is almost identical to the Hex version, except that when three numbers are used, most browsers will just double-up each digit. So, #f30 will become #ff3300</li>
                        <li>Named: cornflowerblue - Although the official W3C specification only lists 16 named colors, almost every browser supports the various named colors</li>
                        <li>RGB: rgb(255, 0, 255) - This allows the user to specify the same thing as Hex, but in Decimal format</li>
                        <li>RGB %: rgb(100%, 0%, 50%) - Almost identical to RGB, but with percentages of each color space instead</li>

                        <li>This can be done with Elements, classes and IDs</li>

                    <p>There are a lot of rules that will accept a compacted ruleset:</p>

                        Note you do not need to specify values for all fields in a compact rule. Just keep the space delimited list in the correct order. For example, you could specify several font values all at once:
                        font: italic small-caps bold 1.3em "helvetica", sans-serif; 
                        or, specify only a select couple.

                    <p>
                        A Pseudo-class is a selector that allows you to reference a specific action or attribute of an element. This is most often used when specifying a attributes, such as :visited and :link.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are other uses for pseudo elements, that will allow for greater detail in styling content, such as :first-letter and :first-line. These allow the browser to apply a style based on an unselected, but displayed element.
                    </p>
                    <p class="important">
                        Best part: No span or div required to access these pseudo-elements.
                    </p>

                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Within a pseudo-elements in particular, it's important to follow a certain order:
                        <ul>
                            <li>a:link</li>

                            <li>a:hover</li>
                            <li>a:active</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Easy mnemonic: LVHA - LoVe - HAte. Because of the way that CSS applies rules, it looks at the LAST rule for a given element and applies more weight to it. For example, if you are hovering over a link, you don't want to see the link state

                        <li>The method is: element[attribute=value]</li>

                        <li>p[align] {color: red;} will turn red any paragraph that contains an align attribute</li>
                        <li>Similarly, img[alt] {border: 1pt red solid; } will draw a red line around all images with an alt attribute</li>
                        <li>You can further direct the attribute selector to find content that is at the beginning (using the carat: ^), somewhere inside (using the asterisk: *) or end of a value (using the dollar sign: $)</li>

                        When a style declaration is found to be in conflict with a previously declared style, there is a method for determining which one will win out. The process is built into every web browser, and almost all of them calculate the values identically (for once!).

                    <h3>
                        Here is how the W3C defines the process by which style order is determined:
                    </h3>
                    <dl>
                        <dt>Discover all declarations</dt>
                        <dd>
                            Find all declarations that apply to the element and property in question, for the target media type. Declarations apply if the associated selector matches the element in question.
                        </dd>
                        <dt>
                            Sheet Order
                        </dt>
                        <dd>
                            The primary sort of the declarations is by weight and origin: for normal declarations, author style sheets override user style sheets which override the default style sheet.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Note: For "!important" declarations, user style sheets override author style sheets which override the default style sheet. "!important" declaration override normal declarations. An imported style sheet has the same origin as the style sheet that imported it.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </dd>
                        <dt>
                            Specificity
                        </dt>
                        <dd>
                            The secondary sort is by specificity of selector: more specific selectors will override more general ones. Pseudo-elements and pseudo-classes are counted as normal elements and classes, respectively
                        </dd>
                        <dt>
                            Sort by Order: 
                        </dt>
                        <dd>
                            Finally, sort by order specified: if two rules have the same weight, origin and specificity, the latter specified wins. Rules in imported style sheets are considered to be before any rules in the style sheet itself.
                        </dd>
                    </dl>

                        Specificity - In Detail

                    <p>
                        is a method for determining what rules are applied when a conflict between two selectors occurs. Through a method of adding values when certain elements and selectors are present, a specificity number can be applied to any CSS rule. The one with highest specificity wins and the associated rule is applied to the element(s) in question.
                    </p>

                        Ruleset for Specificity
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Style sheets can also override conflicting style sheets based on their level of specificity, where a more specific style will always win out over a less specific one. It is simply a counting game to calculate the specificity of a selector.
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Count the number of IDs in the selector.</li>
                        <li>Count the number of CLASS, pseudoclass, and attribute selectors.</li>
                        <li>Count the number of HTML tag names in the selector</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        Next, write the three numbers in exact order with no spaces or commas to obtain a three digit number. (Note, you may need to convert the numbers to a larger base to end up with three digits.) The final list of numbers corresponding to selectors will easily determine specificity with the higher numbers winning out over lower numbers. Following is a list of selectors sorted by specificity:
                    </p>
                    <dl>
