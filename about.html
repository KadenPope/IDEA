                Hello World!  Thank you for taking time to learn more about IDEA and how to make your documents and websites more Inclusive.  Now, you are probably wondering who the brain is behind this website.   It's me!  I'm Kaden Pope (they/them) and I'm passionate about Educating others about Inclusivity and Diversity.  I'm looking forward to seeing a day where the tips and tricks in this website are the norm, not the exception.  Feel free to explore the links below to learn even more about me!

                    Why Inclusive Design?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have had bumps and potholes in my life, but each of these have contributed to my passion for universal design. This is my story.

                        A website created by me would not be complete without me sharing my photography.  This is my perspective of the world we live in.
