                            ScreenReaders or Text-to-Speech software are software that is used by people with low or no vision.  It augments the experience through audible descriptions, along with with keyboard shortcuts it supports navigation.  Alt-text is used to hear image descriptions read aloud, this supports an equal experience when reading documents.

                            When someone has Colour-Blindness, they have difficulty differentiating between certain colour combinations.  The most common combination is red and green, though many other colours combinations can be difficult to diferentiate for different people.  This can make it difficult to interpret images that rely on colour contrast for meaning.  Some people will use Text-To-Speech or ScreenReaders to have the alt-text read aloud to them.

                           Some people who have challenges with visual processing experience the moving of shapes and colours.  This can ]potentially make portions of the image distorted, interchanging colours and people or other image elements may be switched.  This can change the meaning of the image, giving people a different context for images.  This can be minimized with the use of alt-text, giving people the ability to hear the context of the image, correcting any visual discrepancies.

                            Mark as Decorative is used by some people to indicate when a picture is only decoratives.  This can be helpful in very rare cases, including some backgrounds, but in most it eliminates important context.  Do not use it for cartoons or emojis thinking that they are not important.  This is not inclusive as it eliminates this context from ScreenReaders.  People with low vision may not able to join in on the Joke by not knowing that there is a “Winky Emoji” after a joke.

                            I find the Generate alt text more amusing than helpful.  It can come up with some interesting ideas for what an image is and what its purpose is in context.  It can be a good starting point, but I would be careful with its final descriptions.

                                Are you wondering if the alt-text you wrote makes sense?  Ask a friend - read out what you have written and see if they know what the purpose of the image is about.  If they don't get it - show them the image and ask their opinion.  By doing this we are opening the dialogue around inclusive design with others!
